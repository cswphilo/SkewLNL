## Notes and references on implementing linear/non-linear framework to NMILLs with expoential.
- Skew CNC presents commutative/non-commutative logic system. Its corresponding adjunction model is a left skew monoidal adjunction between skew symmetric monoidal closed category and skew monoidal closed category.
- Skew LNL presents two linear/non-linear logic systems, semantics for the first one is a left skew monoidal adjunction between Cartesian closed category and skew symmetric category, the other is between Cartesian closed category and skew monoidal closed category.
- References include Nick Benton's classic paper on LNL logic, Jiang, Eades ,and de Paiva's paper on CNC logic, three papers on adjoint logic which is a modular framework for LNL like logics.
